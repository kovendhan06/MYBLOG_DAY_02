                                           Objects and it's Internal Representation in Java Script
          
                             
                In simple terms "A javascript object is a collection of key values having state and behaviour(properties and method)
                   
                    For example:
                                Person,car,bike ,and personal computer etc....
                   
                    Take the case of cars 
                                All cars have same properties,but the property values differ from car to car.All cars have same the  methods 
               but the methods are performed at different times.
               
                                               Let's have an example
                                                1. make:ford
                                                2. model:2016
                                                3. color:blue
                                                4. fuel:diesel
                                                5. weight:650kg
                                                6. mileage:17kmpl
                                                7. ratings:4.6

                    Objects
                               The following code assigns a simple value (ford) to a variable named car.
                                     
                                                   var car="ford";

                               The following code assingns many values(ford,2016,blue and soo on) to a variable named car.
                                           
                                                     var car={
                                                     make:"ford";

                               The values are written as key:value pairs(key and value seperated by a colon).
                                
                                    Syntax:

                                                                         ...keyN : valueN

                               The key : values pairs are called properties....

                               The object properties can be different primitive values ,other object and functions.

                               properties can usually be changed added, and  deleted, butsome are related only.


                             
                                     The syntax for adding a property to an object is:
                                    

                                          ObjectName.ObjectProperty = PropertyValue;


                               
                                     The syntax for deleting a property to an object is:
                                 

                                          delete objectName.ObjectProperty;
                               
                                 
                                     The syntax can access a property from an objct is:
                              
                                     
                                          Objectname.Property   // car
                                    
                                          ObjectName.["Property"]   //car["make"]

                                          ObjectName[expression]    // x="make";car[x]

                                  

                         Object Methods:
                                     
                                      An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
                             i.e:
                                      Let's assume to start the car there will be mechanical functionality.
                                        
                                           function() {return ignition.on}

                                      and so similar to stop / brake / headlights on & off ,etc...
                                                  

                                                            Thank You
